App Synopsis
------------
This app will be used in the classroom, most likely a class of students falling behind in specific studies, for elementary up to middle school students. A teacher, or two, will work will these students on whatever subject matter they're struggling with (math, science, etc), by assigning specific assignments to their students via tablet/computer and having the child complete each task on their own via tablets.

Since it's directed at younger students it will incorporate games, puzzles, video and small mini-assignments where the student will be able to learn in a way that might not be taught in their normal class, and hopefully grasp the concept of whatever they're learning easier. The app would present the student with a gamificaion attribute, where the child would earn badges or medals depending on what tasks they've completed, how many, and how difficult the task (never for how fast they completed the task, it's not a race!).

This app would also be beneficial for students who are struggling because they don't see the benefit of certain subjects. The app, after completion of each task, will present feedback via a new window (possibly with virtual confetti and twirling stars) congratulating the student on the completion, and a reference to a "cool job" (astronaut, veterinarian, military general, etc) that would require the knowledge the student just learned. 

The tablets themselves will be school property, and are not allowed to leave school grounds, making these a part of the teacher's curriculum, and not a tool to use as homework. 

Possible future additions could be allowing the student to take notes during class, leave comments next to homework assignments, or message the teacher directly if they have a question.

User Personas
----------------

Georgia Stevenson:
    40 years old, Georgia has been a teacher for 10+ years. She started with middle school, and worked her way to eventually ending up with elementary schools students (4th and 5th graders). Having a history with older children, she knows just what her students need to know, and be prepared for, in the next few years. She's not a wiz with technology; her teenage kids have the latest phones, but she only uses hers for phone and email. But thanks to her kids, and younger colleagues, she's able to traverse her way through easy apps with relatively no problem.

Leonardo Fischer:
    56 years old, Leonardo has been teaching all his life. He works in an intercity school, helping middle school kids keep their grades up and focusing on education rather than getting mixed up in gangs, dropping out, etc. Leonardo doesn't have a family at home (never married, no pets), and his life at work is, in his opinion, is the most important thing. Being older, he doesn't have the best time using technology. He doesn't own an iPod, still has a flip phone, and the most technological thing in his home is 10yr old desktop computer. Using technology in school isn't his ideal method of teaching, but he understands that kids these days like something familiar, and he wants to better his students education best he can.

Darla Mathers:
    11 years old, Darla is just starting 5th grade this year. She's been struggling with math since 3rd grade, and her parents are thinking of hiring her a tutor (an idea she's not happy about). She understands that she needs to have good grades, but doesn't see the point in learning about numbers. She has an older brother who's obsessed with his tablet, usually playing games with his friends, and she thinks that owning a tablet is the coolest thing. Her family has a "family computer" that they keep in the living room, so she's played games on kid-friendly websites, and her parents have bought her a few educational games when she was little.

Use Cases and Scenarios
------------------------

Leonardo:
    Leronardo has a new students coming into his class halfway through the first half of the year. Darla, Leonardo's new student, has been struggling with learning fractions and thus has been transfered to Leonardo's class (he teaches the lowest level, specifically for kids struggling). Leonardo needs to add Darla's information into the system, and assign him his first 2 tasks in math.
    
    - Leonardo clicks on "New Student" button
    - he types in Darla's full name
    - he types in his contact information (provided by the school)
    - he types in what subject(s) he's struggling with
    - he clicks "Add Student" button

    - Leonardo clicks "New Task" button
    - he types in Darla's name (somewhat like Slack or Gmail where all names starting with D show up, and he can just click on which student he means)
    - he clicks on "Subject"
    - he scrolls to "Math"
    - he scrolls to "Fractions" (each grade's curriculum will be pre-entered via the school administrative bodies)
    - he selects 2 thumbnails of tasks for Darla to complete (1 puzzle, 1 video) from a list of 5+ pre-determined tasks (approved by the school administrative bodies)
    - he click "Assign Tasks" button

    *Leonardo helps Darla sign in with his first.last name and pre-determined password*


Darla: 
    Darla has just been transfered to a lower level math class. It's her first day and her teacher is adding her information to the new system. She was in a standard classroom with worksheets and "lectures." Darla is handed a new tablet and given a password from her new teacher so she can sign in. Her teacher explains the app she'll be using, and Darla implores he let her continue on her own (after all, she's seen her brother use tablets all her life!).
