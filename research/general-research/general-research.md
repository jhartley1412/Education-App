    - the US is behind most Asian countires and a number of Europian and some South American countries in Math, Science and English
    - more money spent on students ≠ "smarter" students

http://www.greatschools.org/gk/articles/u-s-students-compare/
    - Finland, a country that is rated higher than us in school systems...
        + promote socializing and "self-reflection" over academics
        + require higher education for teachers (master's degrees, "checks and balances" like teacher colleage system, continued career training)
        + free college
        + preschools don't have set "academic targets"
    - America still #1 in competitiveness

    - students learn well with "multisensory instruction;" hearing, seeing, smelling, etc

- have student use a stylis for some assignments to better grasp concept of something (writing stuff out helps memory)
- tablets will be for "school use" only, no taking tablets home (these would be used in a "connections" class——class for helping students catch up)

http://info.shiftelearning.com/blog/difference-between-elearning-and-mlearning
    - elearning: desktop-internet, 20-30min, detailed information (more "textbook style")
    - mlearning: mobile, quick little snippets (3-10min)
        + designing for mlearning usually means one concept on the screen at a time

http://www.infoprolearning.com/instructional-recommendation-mobile-learning-elearning-classroom-training/
    - effective elarning uses "videos, simulations, animations, role-plays, and quizzes will add to the interactivity resulting in enhanced learning"
