    - Finland, a country that is rated higher than us in school systems...
        + promote socializing and "self-reflection" over academics
        + require higher education for teachers (master's degrees, "checks and balances" like teacher colleage system, continued career training)
        + free college
        + preschools don't have set "academic targets"
    - America still #1 in competitiveness
