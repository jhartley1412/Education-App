Sites for Inspiration
----------------------

swap.com (https://www.swap.com)
	I love how clean this site is, lot's of white space. I also really like the color's they're using; bright, colorful, and across the spectrum. A lot like kid's building blocks, it's bright, but not overwhelming.


PBS kids (http://pbskids.org)
	Surprisingly clean for a site that uses super bright colors. There's a lot happening visually, but not a lot where the user needs to click. It's very "kid-heavy" (duh) but both user experience wise as well as aesthetically.

Today's Parent (http://www.todaysparent.com)
	I really like how both bright, yet muted the color scheme on this site is. The text is big, super easy to read, and the card widgets on the main page are kind of what I want to do with my assignments/tasks for the student dashboard.
