Style Tile 1
--------------
My first instinct towards this project, this style tile is about adventure and childhood imagination. When I was first conceptualizing this app it was going to be much more game-based. Kids would play through games and learn without necessarily knowing it/trying to. It would be more like kids learning from experiences and adventures and learning from that. 
Most of the colors are taken from those old toy dinosaurs figurines that kids buy at museums and toy stores. The orange is the "learning" color that balances out against the purples and green that represent outside adventure and childhood imagination. The gradient button works towards this as well. Gradient's are good for "cool" displays and young minds. Having the drop shadow on the static one adds to differentiations them as well.

The second style tile is much more heavy on the learning and educational side of things. Color wise, it's much more like a little kids educational TV show, and the typefaces chosen are both kid-friendly yet not distracting. Raleway especially is clean, easy to read, and good for bit's of instructional information. The main two colors are blue, more the obvious choice for education. Yellow and red are to balance out the blues, make them pop and stand out more. With a younger audience in mind, making easy to read, more square buttons (very slightly rounded edge so as not to look too serious) seems more appropriate.

This final style tile is the more traditionally school centric. Not quite education per say, but more focusing on the setting of school. The greens and light yellow color call to the old-school chalkboards and desks of a classroom, and the blue is for the educational side of things. Buttons are stylish, yet not distracting or taking away form whatever main content is on the page. This is also the only style tile with a serif typeface, seeing as how it's the most classic educational-wise. Arimo is also another clean and super readable font for use with instructions.
