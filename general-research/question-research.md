FINAL PROJECT QUESTION NOTES   
-----------------------------

How common is modern tech (tablets) in school right now?
    Tablets and technology use in schools is still a fairly new concept, that a lot of schools are trying out, but there really isn't any mainstream use of tablets in schools yet [5]. However, schools that are implementing tablets are doing so abundantly; using  tablets for tests, school portals, textbooks and educational videos [6].


What age group are people using tech in most? Is it effective in their learning?
    There are studies and research being done on both younger classrooms (kindergarten - 12)[1], [4], as well as college aged students [2]. Although in this day and age, even 1st graders have experience using tablets and computers [1]. There is a lot of pressure/dependence on the teachers and courses; "...instructional design and comfort with technology are significant factors." [2]. There is a big portion that is dependent on the teacher themselves, and their ability to teach/understand the technology their students are using and how best to implement the tools [3]. Yet, integrating technology into the classroom aides both teacher's pedagogical skills ("teaching" abilities), and students social and motivational and engagement in learning [2]. Of course there are downsides to all teaching methods (with tablets, it's the costs, how easily distraction happens, and, in case of reading and memorizing, reading printed text is more memorable for most people than reading on a screen), at the end of the day, tablets aide students in learning material faster, score higher on tests, and make learning more immersive and fun [7].



Are they geared more towards being a "technology tool?" or "educational entertainment" devices?
    A lot of schools that currently use tablets in schools claim that students are using them mostly as teaching tools; to look up information, read textbooks, and take tests [6]. Less amounts of students will use the tablets to play non-school related games, or goof off.
    


What is the ratio of underprivileged to private schools? (and everything in between)
    "lower-income children (ages 0- 8) have more than 50% less experience using mobile devices than higher-income children" [2]. However, with younger students, even kids not immersed in technology (4-11 years old) learn the basic concepts of using a tablet by the end of their first month, if not sooner [4], [5].


What does research say about tablet's place in education? (is it viable?)
    eLearning and mLearning have a lot of credible information backing up their credibility [1], [2].
    There are a lot of studies that show that technology in the classroom boost student engagement and academic performance "across learning styles." [2]. In some studies done, kids using tablets in schools had higher scores than kids who didn't (in letter identification) [4].


Are tablets typically owned by schools (can't bring them home) or are they given to students directly?
    In almost all studies, tablets stay on school property, but in schools actively using tablets in schools, 75% of students can take tablets home with them [6].
