Education App Plan
-------------------

This project has one main goal; to inspire, encourage and spark interest in young students in schools who are struggling or disinterested in particular subjects. This app will target late elementary - middle school aged, when kids tend to become more disinterested in school, start to struggle more in classes and develop (or don't) studying skills that carry on to their later years. Teachers would ideally be able to have control within the appâ€“-have their own profile, and set up lessons, activities, or "homework" that their students would be able to work on on their own, or in class (depending on the class structure). The students would be able to earn badges, achieve "awards," and view past progress. The teachers would also be able to see their students progress with certain subjects, lessons or activities, and possible see how long it took that student to complete each task.
Ideally this would be for schools to eventually implement into their curriculum, and multiple schools are already testing how tablets can be used in a classroom. I imagine this would be something like that, to further engage a child's education.

Why?
    Students struggling in schools tend to have less of a chance to catch up, and students who aren't interested in certain subjects when they're young can miss out on career opportunities when they're older. This app is meant to help educate and encourage students struggling with one subject achieve either the motivation, or the extra help they need to engage in a subject in school.

How?
    Build an app that possesses mini games, lessons, and gamification attributes that encourage learning and makes learning something to strive for.
    
What?
    A web/tablet app would be the most convenient way to get this tool to both students and teachers. Tablets are already being used throughout multiple schools as a learning tool to help teach and engage kids within class using technology they understand/can relate to.
