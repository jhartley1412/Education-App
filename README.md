This is my Iron Yard final project; an app for teachers to use in elementary schools to better encourage and teach students become more interested in subjects they otherwise wouldn't be interested/struggle in.


App Synopsis
------------
This app will be used in the classroom, most likely a class of students falling behind in specific studies, for elementary up to middle school students. A teacher, or two, will work will these students on whatever subject matter they're struggling with (math, science, etc), by assigning specific assignments to their students via tablet/computer and having the child complete each task on their own via tablets.

Since it's directed at younger students it will incorporate games, puzzles, video and small mini-assignments where the student will be able to learn in a way that might not be taught in their normal class, and hopefully grasp the concept of whatever they're learning easier. The app would present the student with a gamificaion attribute, where the child would earn badges or medals depending on what tasks they've completed, how many, and how difficult the task (never for how fast they completed the task, it's not a race!).

This app would also be beneficial for students who are struggling because they don't see the benefit of certain subjects. The app, after completion of each task, will present feedback via a new window (possibly with virtual confetti and twirling stars) congratulating the student on the completion, and a reference to a "cool job" (astronaut, veterinarian, military general, etc) that would require the knowledge the student just learned. 

The tablets themselves will be school property, and are not allowed to leave school grounds, making these a part of the teacher's curriculum, and not a tool to use as homework. 

Possible future additions could be allowing the student to take notes during class, leave comments next to homework assignments, or message the teacher directly if they have a question.
